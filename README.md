# Android architecture components template

A sample project that integrates Kotlin coroutines, Retrofit, Koin, Room, Navigation Architecture component, ViewModel/LiveData, and data binding; intended to show a good starting point for a MVVM project.

Also has a branch that holds an implementation using Dagger 2 instead of Koin.
